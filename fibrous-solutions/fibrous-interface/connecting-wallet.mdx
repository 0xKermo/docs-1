## Compatibility and Requirements

At Fibrous, we understand the importance of accessibility. As such, rest assured that there's no need for additional applications or tools when using Fibrous. Owning one of the supported wallets suffices. Fibrous is designed to integrate smoothly with these wallets, ensuring you a hassle-free experience.

Fibrous has an interface where you can easily connect both many prominent wallets designed for use on EVM networks and Starknet-native wallets.

## Connecting a Wallet

To connect your Web3 wallet, click on the Connect Wallet button at the top right of the page. This will bring up a wallet selection pop-up where various wallet connection options will be displayed.

## Portfolio Tab

After connecting a Web3 wallet, when you click on the tab at the top right of the interface where your address or ENS/StarknetID domain is displayed, you can view an account summary for your connected address. In this tab, you can review the assets available in Fibrous for your address and access historical information about the transactions you have performed on Fibrous.
